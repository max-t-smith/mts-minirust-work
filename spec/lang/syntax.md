# MiniRust Abstract Syntax

This defines the abstract syntax of MiniRust programs.

## Expressions

MiniRust has two kinds of expressions:
*value expressions* evaluate to a value and are found, in particular, on the right-hand side of assignments;
*place expressions* evaluate to a place and are found, in particular, in the left-hand side of assignments.

Obviously, these are all quite incomplete still.

### Value expressions

```rust
/// A "value expression" evaluates to a `Value`.
pub enum ValueExpr {
    /// Just return a constant value.
    Constant(Constant, Type),
    /// An n-tuple, used for arrays, structs, tuples (including unit).
    Tuple(List<ValueExpr>, Type),
    /// A `Union` value.
    Union {
        /// The union's field which will be initialized.
        field: Int,
        /// The value it will be initialized with.
        #[specr::indirection]
        expr: ValueExpr,
        /// The union type, needs to be `Type::Union`
        union_ty: Type,
    },
    /// A variant of an enum type.
    Variant {
        /// The discriminant of the variant.
        discriminant: Int,
        /// The `ValueExpr` for the variant.
        #[specr::indirection]
        data: ValueExpr,
        /// The enum type, needs to be `Type::Enum`.
        enum_ty: Type,
    },
    /// Read the discriminant of an enum type.
    /// As we don't need to know the validity of the inner data
    /// we don't fully load the variant value.
    GetDiscriminant {
        /// The place where the enum is located.
        #[specr::indirection]
        place: PlaceExpr,
    },
    /// Load a value from memory.
    Load {
        /// The place to load from.
        #[specr::indirection]
        source: PlaceExpr,
    },
    /// Create a pointer (raw pointer or reference) to a place.
    AddrOf {
        /// The place to create a pointer to.
        #[specr::indirection]
        target: PlaceExpr,
        /// The type of the created pointer.
        ptr_ty: PtrType,
    },
    /// Unary operators.
    UnOp {
        operator: UnOp,
        #[specr::indirection]
        operand: ValueExpr,
    },
    /// Binary operators.
    BinOp {
        operator: BinOp,
        #[specr::indirection]
        left: ValueExpr,
        #[specr::indirection]
        right: ValueExpr,
    },
}

/// Constants are basically values, but cannot have explicit provenance.
/// Currently we do not support Ptr and Union constants.
pub enum Constant {
    /// A mathematical integer, used for `i*`/`u*` types.
    Int(Int),
    /// A Boolean value, used for `bool`.
    Bool(bool),
    /// A pointer pointing into a global allocation with a given offset.
    GlobalPointer(Relocation),
    /// A pointer pointing to a function.

    /// The return type is given by `PointerMetaKind::ty()`, e.g., for a thin pointer this is `()`.
    GetMetadata,
    /// Returns the dynamic size of the type given the pointer metadata.
    /// The operand must be a matching metadata for the type. For sized types this is `()`.

    /// Returns the dynamic alignment of the type given the pointer metadata.
    /// The operand must be a matching metadata for the type. For sized types this is `()`.

    /// Throws UB if right operand not in range 0..left::BITS.
    ShlUnchecked,
    /// Shift right `>>` (arithmetic shift for unsigned integers, logical shift for signed integers)
    Shr,
    /// Shift right `>>` (arithmetic shift for unsigned integers, logical shift for signed integers)
    /// Throws UB if right operand not in range 0..left::BITS.
    ShrUnchecked,

}
```

### Place expressions

```rust
/// A "place expression" evaluates to a `Place`.
pub enum PlaceExpr {
    /// Denotes a local variable.
    Local(LocalName),
    /// Dereference a value (of pointer/reference type).
    Deref {
        #[specr::indirection]
        operand: ValueExpr,
        // The type of the newly created place.
        ty: Type,
    },
    /// Project to a field.
    Field {
        /// The place to base the projection on.
        #[specr::indirection]
        root: PlaceExpr,
        /// The field to project to.
        field: Int,
    },
    /// Index to an array or slice element.
    Index {
        /// The array or slice to index into.
        #[specr::indirection]
        root: PlaceExpr,
        /// The index to project to.
        #[specr::indirection]
        index: ValueExpr,
    },
    /// Enum variant downcast.
    Downcast {
        /// The base enum to project to the specific variant.
        #[specr::indirection]
        root: PlaceExpr,
        /// The discriminant of the variant to project to.
        discriminant: Int,
    },
}
```

## Statements, terminators

Next, the statements and terminators that MiniRust programs consist of:

```rust
pub enum Statement {
    /// Copy value from `source` to `destination`.
    Assign {
        destination: PlaceExpr,
        source: ValueExpr,
    },
    /// Evaluate a place without accessing it.
    /// This is the result of translating e.g. `let _ = place;`.
    PlaceMention(PlaceExpr),
    /// Set the discriminant of the variant at `destination` to `value`.
    SetDiscriminant {
        destination: PlaceExpr,
        value: Int,
    },
    /// Ensure that `place` contains a valid value of its type (else UB).
    /// Also perform retagging and ensure safe pointers are dereferenceable.
    ///
    /// The frontend is generally expected to generate this for all function argument,
    /// and possibly in more places.
    Validate {
        place: PlaceExpr,
        /// Indicates whether this operation occurs as part of the prelude
        /// that we have at the top of each function (which affects retagging).
        fn_entry: bool,
    },
    /// De-initialize a place.
    Deinit {
        place: PlaceExpr,
    },
    /// Allocate the backing store for this local.
    StorageLive(LocalName),
    /// Deallocate the backing store for this local.
    StorageDead(LocalName),
}

pub enum Terminator {
    /// Just jump to the next block.
    Goto(BbName),
    /// `value` needs to evaluate to a `Value::Int`.
    /// `cases` map those values to blocks to jump to and therefore have to have the equivalent type.
    /// If no value matches we fall back to the block given in `fallback`.

        value: ValueExpr,
        cases: Map<Int, BbName>,
        fallback: BbName,
    },
    /// If this is ever executed, we have UB.
    Unreachable,
    /// Invoke the given intrinsic operation with the given arguments.
    ///
    /// Intrinsics are langauge primitives that can have arbitrary side-effects, including divergence.
    Intrinsic {
        intrinsic: IntrinsicOp,
        /// The arguments to pass.
        arguments: List<ValueExpr>,
        /// The place to put the return value into.
        ret: PlaceExpr,

        /// If `None`, UB will be raised when the intrinsic returns.

    },
    /// Call the given function with the given arguments.
    Call {
        /// What function or method to call.
        /// This must evaluate to a function pointer and for safe behaviour, the functions signature must match the arguments.
        ///
        /// Dynamic dispatch is represented with the callee being the result of `VTableMethodLookup(GetMetadata(self))`,
        /// and the `self` argument appropriately cast to a thin pointer type.
        callee: ValueExpr,
        /// The calling convention to use for this call.
        calling_convention: CallingConvention,
        /// The arguments to pass.
        arguments: List<ArgumentExpr>,
        /// The place to put the return value into.
        ret: PlaceExpr,

        /// The block to jump to when this call unwinds.
        /// If `None`, UB will be raised when the function unwinds.
        /// This comes with a well-formedness requirement: if the current block is a regular block,
        /// `unwind_block` must be either a cleanup block or a catch block;
        /// otherwise, `unwind_block` must be a terminating block.
        unwind_block: Option<BbName>,
    },
    /// Return from the current function.
    Return,
    /// Starts unwinding, jump to the indicated cleanup block.
    StartUnwind(BbName),
    /// Stops unwinding, jump to the indicated regular block.
    StopUnwind(BbName),
    /// Ends this function call. The unwinding should continue at the caller's stack frame.
    ResumeUnwind,
}

/// Function arguments can be passed by-value or in-place.
pub enum ArgumentExpr {
    /// Pass a copy of this value to the function.
    ///
    /// Technically this could be encoded by generating a fresh temporary, copying the value there, and doing in-place passing.
    /// FIXME: is it worth providing this mode anyway?

    /// Pass the argument value in-place; the contents of this place may be altered arbitrarily by the callee.
    InPlace(PlaceExpr),
}

/// The `CallingConvention` defines how function arguments and return values are passed.
///

pub enum CallingConvention {
    Rust, C,
}

pub enum IntrinsicLockOp {
    Acquire,
    Release,
    Create,
}

/// The intrinsic operations supported by MiniRust.
/// Generally we only make things intrinsics if they cannot be operands, i.e.
/// they are non-deterministic or mutate the global state.
/// We also make them intrinsic if they return `()`, because an operand that
/// does not return anything is kind of odd.
pub enum IntrinsicOp {
    Abort,
    Assume,

    PointerWithExposedProvenance,
}
```

## Programs and functions

Finally, the general structure of programs and functions:

```rust
/// Opaque types of names for functions, vtables, trait methods, and globals.
/// The internal representations of these types do not matter.
pub struct FnName(pub libspecr::Name);
pub struct GlobalName(pub libspecr::Name);

pub struct TraitMethodName(pub libspecr::Name);

/// A closed MiniRust program.

    pub statements: List<Statement>,
    pub terminator: Terminator,
    pub kind: BbKind,
}

/// The kind of a basic block in the CFG.

    /// Regular blocks may use `Return` and `StartUnwind` but not `ResumeUnwind`.
    Regular,

    Terminate,
}

/// A global allocation.

    /// The alignment with which this global shall be allocated.
    pub align: Align,

/// A pointer into a global allocation.
pub struct Relocation {
    /// The name of the global allocation we are pointing into.
    pub name: GlobalName,
    /// The offset within that allocation.
    pub offset: Offset,
